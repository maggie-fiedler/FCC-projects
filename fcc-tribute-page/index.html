      <p id="tribute-info">Only Prince could make a song that has the arc of a sermon, with the passion of an orgasm. You feel like you’re catching the holy ghost as it takes over your body, but halfway through you realize that’s not Jesus, you’re actually just having sex. And after the song’s final two minutes transforms you, sending you to a place you typically are fearful of visiting, it just ends. And just like that, you look down, and it’s your own personal Garden of Eden. Figuratively, and perhaps literally, you realize you’re naked.

Prince stripped us down to our core his entire career. Much like his voice, his guitar playing, and his style, he was unmatched when it came to expressing vulnerability, showing us all how to risk it all and lay it on the line. And it wasn’t always comfortable. Prince’s way of always being Prince was often met with confusion, and occasionally it wasn’t accepted, but looking back, it was always necessary.

The only thing that’s easing the news of his death is that I still can’t believe he was real. It’s mind-blowing that Earth got 57 years of Prince Rogers Nelson.</p>
